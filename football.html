              <strong>Football</strong> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 
              Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand);
               Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] 
               These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as <strong>"football codes".</strong>

            <h2>History Of Football</h2>
            <span>
                The Chinese competitive game cuju is an early type of ball game where feet were used, in some aspects resembling modern association football.
                 It was possibly played around the Han dynasty and early Qin dynasty, based on an attestation in a military manual from around the second to third centuries BC.[15][16][17] 
                 In one version, gameplay consisted of players passing the ball between teammates without allowing it to touch the ground (much like keepie uppie). In its competitive version, two teams had to pass the ball without it falling, before kicking the ball through a circular hole placed in the middle of the pitch. 
                 Unlike association football, the two teams did not interact with each other but instead stayed on opposite sides of the pitch.[18] 
                Cuju has been cited by FIFA as the earliest form of football.[4]
